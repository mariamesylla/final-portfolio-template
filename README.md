# Apprenticeship Final Portfolio

This repository is a collection of some of my key learnings during the 15-month apprenticeship (October 2023-March 2025) with the Multiverse Apprenticeship Program at American Express. Through these projects, I have demonstrated my skills to learn quickly and adapt to changes within my environment. I have conquered many challenges along the way and it is a pleasure to share this repository.

Enjoy!


## Overview of Apprenticeship

During my time at American Express, I delivered value not only through improvements to my team's codebase but also by adding additional functionality. In this time I assisted in implementing a new component to the existing codebase, as well as, working on various user stories, epics, and bug fixes.

## Portfolio Introduction
Hello! ðŸ‘‹ , my name is Magnan Sylla! I am a Full Stack Software Engineer Apprentice at American Express. Coding has  always been something I was interested in. When I was graduating for my Associate degree in Computer Science (2023) , I decided to start my first boot camp, and it has been quite the journey ever since! I love coding because every day there is something new to learn, a new framework to master, a new syntax to learn, and a new way of writing an algorithm. Plus, coding is all around us, it influences the world around us and helps to make the world a better place.

I enjoy seeing my hard work come to fruition and seeing the impact that it has on my team. I can honestly say that throughout this apprenticeship, I have truly tested my limits to see how far I could go. I have worked on a team of 5-6 developers and we have built great things together. I took part in my first major team project, focusing on frontend development as well as backend, full-stack application development, and deployment. At Amex, I have utilized the skills that I learned not only from Multiverse, but from ny team. These skills have helped to work and collaborate with my teammates as well as develop solutions for our  customers. I have a special interest in fullstack web development, especially front-end design.
